# Solvadoku
An android application that solves and provides steps on how a Sudoku puzzle was solved.

This application is built over Base classes that have been forked from https://github.com/CookieCrumbs19212/Sudoku_Puzzle

Solvadoku uses a wide range of strategies to solve any puzzle you throw at it. Our Partial Solve feature gives you the freedom to choose any combination of strategies and Solvadoku will attempt to solve as much of the puzzle as possible using only the chosen algorithms.

The Sudoku solving strategies we use:

Version(1.1) • Naked Single • Hidden Single • Naked Pair • Pointing Pair • Claiming Pair • Hidden Pair • Naked Triple • X-Wing • Swordfish • Brute Force

Version(1.1) also provides pencil marks when partial solving and this feature can be turned on or off in settings.

And we plan on expanding this list in future updates.

The intuitive User Interface allows you to easily navigate the app and take full advantage of its features. Once you have solved a puzzle, look to the top right-hand corner and hit the refresh button to tackle a new one.
